# TypeWire

TypeWire is a super-fast TypeScript static analysis tool written in Rust. It captures static information about TypeScript code and generates easy-to-understand analytics that tell you about complexity and maintainability issues that you may want to address.

TypeWrite uses [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to parse your code then runs analysis routines to understand it.
